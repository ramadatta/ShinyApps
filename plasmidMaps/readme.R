take a genbank and generate BRIG like figure
Color code the genes into AMR, IS, Transposons, Insertion Sequences, Virulence genes, Hypothetical Proteins
If any genes need to colored those genes should be passed
Shiny app - we can select AMR, IS, Transposons, Insertion Sequences, Virulence genes, Hypothetical Proteins the option we want to see on the circular genome
