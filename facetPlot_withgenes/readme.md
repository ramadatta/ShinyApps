This app should take gubbins and roary output:
  1. filtered_polymorphic_sites.fasta - for drawing snp tree - output from gubbins
  2. core_gene_alignment.aln.vcf (for plotting snp positions in core genome) - output from roary 
  3. core_alignment_header.embl (for gene coordinates in core genome) - output from roary

Side panel, select genes to display

main panel 

SNP tree - SNPs with | at the respective core genome position - bottom most below x-axis selected genes based on the side panel - if recombination gff is given should plot recombination as well in the plot
